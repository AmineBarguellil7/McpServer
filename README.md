# McpServer

This project is about building an MCP server that lets you add, read, and summarize notes. 
It defines custom tools like add_note() and read_notes() to interact with a local notes.txt file, and a resource (notes://latest) to get the most recent note. 
It also includes a prompt to generate a summary of all saved notes using note_summary_prompt().
