# McpServer

This project is about building an MCP server that lets you add, read, and summarize notes. 
It defines custom tools like add_note() and read_notes() to interact with a local notes.txt file, and a resource (notes://latest) to get the most recent note. 
It also includes a prompt to generate a summary of all saved notes using note_summary_prompt().
I've successfully implemented and tested all of these features in the 𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐤𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐚𝐩𝐩 which allows me to manage my notes directly through 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐞'𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞.
